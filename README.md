# Block-PT2399

A simple delay/echo design block based on the venerable PTC PT2399.

## Background

I've been working on a blues harp preamp for a buddy, and have been working on
the design in logical blocks that more or less get strung together. (It makes a
lot of sense when looking at valve gain stages, which are all basically the same
circuit repeated, maybe with different component values.) He mentioned wanting
delay or echo, and so I put this together. It is not a ground-up design, but
rather one that was inspired by the countless examples of using the PT2399
that you can find in the wild. (Sometimes it's better to stand on the shoulders
of giants.)

Anyhow, I decided to do up a board for ease of use in future projects.
